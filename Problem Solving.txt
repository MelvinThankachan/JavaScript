Understand the problem
----------------------
    - When you can explain the problem to someone else in plain English, you understand it.
    - To gain clarity and understanding of the problem, write it down on paper, reword it in plain English until it makes sense to you, and draw diagrams if that helps.

Plan
----
    - What are the inputs?
    - What is the desired output?
    - What are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
    - What is the algorithm to solve the problem?
    - Write the Pseudocode

Pseudocode
----------
    - Pseudocode is writing out the logic for your program in natural language instead of code.
    - It helps you slow down and think through the steps your program will have to go through to solve the problem.
    - Example:
        - When the user inputs a number
        - Initialize a counter variable and set its value to zero
        - While counter is smaller than user inputted number increment the counter by one
        - Print the value of the counter variable

Divide and conquer
------------------
    - Divide the big problem to sub-problems
    - And word on the sub-problems
    - Don't try to solve the big problem in one go.
