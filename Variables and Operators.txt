Naming Variables
----------------

- There are 3 rules on variable names in JavaScript:

    - The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
    - The first character must not be a digit.
    - Names should not be a reserved keyword. 

- When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used. That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting with a capital letter: myVeryLongName.

- Variables named apple and APPLE are two different variables. Variable names are case sensitive.



Arithmetic Operators
--------------------

+ 	Addition
- 	Subtraction
* 	Multiplication
** 	Exponentiation (ES6)
/ 	Division
% 	Modulus (Remainder)
++ 	Increment
-- 	Decrement


Numbers
-------

- JavaScript Numbers are Always 64-bit Floating Point

- Integer Precision
    Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits.
    Example
    let x = 999999999999999;   // x will be 999999999999999
    let y = 9999999999999999;  // y will be 10000000000000000 

- If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string concatenation

- JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations

- NaN is a number: typeof NaN returns number

- Infinity

- Unary addition do the same operation which the Number(...) do.
